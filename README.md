Functional JavaScript: Past, Present & Future
---------------------------------------------

Despite its name and association with terms like "higher order functions", "partial function application" and "functional composition", functional programming isn't simply "programming with functions". It's a whole different way to think about and structure your code to increase readability, understandability and predictability, and as it turns out JavaScript is tailor-made for this approach.

In this presentation we'll discuss the underlying concepts of functional programming, explore the aspects of JavaScript that make it easy to adopt those concepts, functionalize some example code with plain, old, vanilla JavaScript that you're probably already using on a daily basis, and then take a quick peek at a feature in ECMAScript 6 that encourages us to embrace the functional revolution.
